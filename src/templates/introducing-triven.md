title: Introducing Triven
date: {date}

---

Triven is a Markdown-based blog generator. It's different from well-known solutions like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby. It was designed to build a minimal blog, not to create an entire website. By *minimal*, it means almost zero features. Tailored to highlight the content, not the form, it offers no themes, no menus, no any other thing that could take the readers' eyes away from your words.

## Getting started

If you landed here, chances are you're familiar with coding and, therefore, well versed with JavaScript.  
Before getting started with Triven, you need to install it in your project as follows:

```
npm install -D @glorious/triven
```

After installing it, you can see Triven in action by running the following command:
```
npx triven build
```
It will create a blog ready to be published in a directory called `triven` in the root of your project.
You can optionally customize some build details as the source directory for Markdown files, the output directory for the final files generated, among other things.
